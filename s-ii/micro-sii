in the name of ALLAH

quantity decide

or price decide 

we decide either quantity or price

if we control price, then demand will be not be in our hand

if we control demand, then price will not be our hand

price less, demand high

demand high, price less

qd=50-2p if control demand (demand function)

2p=50-qd if control price (inverse-demand-function)

if we decide qunatity, price will be out of our hand

if things not selling, we will drop price to clear the quantity

with how much discount, how much demand will increase 

30 percent discount,how much demand will increase

inverse demand function is inverse of demand function

demand increase sellers will try to increase price

change in demand is equal to change in price

demands are necessities (necesseries)

wants are unlimited (wishes)

non-price factors that effect demand------

change in demand is brought by change in price

shift in demand means shifting from this demand to some other

change in demand is because of price

shift in demand is because of following factors in slides

shifters 

shifter move the graph to either upward or downward

moving up and down in graph is change in demand 

moving horizontally, (left or right) in graph is shift in demand

because of shifters we move from one price to the other

shifters------------

change in income:

inferior goods are those which we can affoard

full demand function:

E is expectation

P is price

Ps is price of substitute

Pc is price of commentary in price

A is advertisement 

Y is monthly income 

Pop is population

E is expectation

two policy variables

1-price low

2-make more advertisement

these two are policy variables inorder to takle competitors or to manage competition or manage price change

other things Y,Ps,Pc,A,Pop are shifters

saving of cost is benefit  

--------------------------------------ELASTICITY--------------

business try to make elastic

governmnet and public try to make thing inelastic	

friction means divided by 1 

percentage means divided by 100

elasticity = %change in quantity/%change in price

when change is minute we calculate point elasticity

more price, more elastic

less price, less elastic

when price increased, revenue increased, it means demand is inelastic

when price increased, revenue same, it means demand is unit elastic

when price increased, revenue decreased, it means demand is 
elastic

price depends on the elasticity of demand

business man try to make demand inelastic

indirect tax:

duty,
income tax,
fee tax
electric bill tax

indirect applied where demand is inelastic

in law of demand sign of elasticity will be negative but we take absolute value of it

if alternate available, thing will be elastic

if alternate not available, thing will be in elastic

for necessities will be inelastic
	
change in quantity/demand due to change in income,(income elasticity of demand)


it can be positive or negative

cross elasticity, change in price of subsitute

if price increase what will be on the effect on price of cars

it can be negative and positive as well

price increase, consumer surplus decreases 

price decrease, consumer surplus increases

price where demand 0 - actual price * quantity / 2

SUPPLY-----------------------------

in supply, we consider consumer surplus 

change is because of price

shift is because of other factors

supply is dependent

price is independent variable

product supply increases with increase in price

input cost means wages increased

input cost increase supply will decreases

input cost decrease supply will increase

labour productivity increase supply will increase

change in quantity supply divided by change in price is called elasticity of supply 

its sign is positive

sign of elasticity of demand is negative and we take absolute of that

in elasticity of supply curve:

if crossing x-axis, it is inelastic

if crossing origin, it is unit elastic 

if crossing y-axis, it is elastic

in supply we get the idea from the shape

while in demand we cannot predict from the shape 

percent change in supply divided by percent change in price (elasticity of supply)

and its sign will be positive	 

sometimes you can increase supply while sometime you cannot increase the supply with increase in price

elasticity of supply is with respect to time

the forumula of elasticity of supply and elasticity of demand are the same 

horizontal infinity, vertical 0, cross x axis then < 1, cross origin equal to 1, cross y-axis then >1. This is about elasticity of supply 

market period is the period is the period in which you cannot increase or decrease the supply 

demand increase supply increase

demand decrease supply decrease 

short-run period: in which you can take some action

at market period it is zero

long period it is elastic

short period it is inelastic

market equilibrium:

where supply and demand becomes equal

market equilibrium is the point where demand and supply curve intersect

when shortage price push upward

intrest rate high means money is doubling very fast

intrest - inflation is called real intrest

wage rate - inflation is called real WAGE

anything - inflation become real thatthing

intrest rate is increased to control the inflation

To stable currency, we increase the intrest rate

if currency falling, then intrest rate will increase

enterpreneur inovates he don't invent

islamic partnership is called as musharka

partnership has unlimited liability 

only 1 time tax is applied in sole properietership and partnership business

corporations or joint stock companies are the main who spreaded communism

prefferd shared are bond

ordinary shared means if profit occur you'll get money, if not you'll not get anything

in corporations,

first pay government dues

then pay banks

then pay third party companies

in corporations, there is double taxation

corporations are complex therefore proper entrepreneurs are required to run the company 

in communist system, big corporations are maintaing the system

in market economy, there are also some big companies managing the system/economy
